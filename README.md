# Python Adaptation of "Forecasting: Principles and Practice"

Welcome to our project! This repository is dedicated to transforming the incredible insights found in [Forecasting: Principles and Practice](https://otexts.com/fpp3/), a book by Rob J. Hyndman and George Athanasopoulos, into Python-friendly content.

Our mission is to enable Python enthusiasts and developers to harness the extensive knowledge encapsulated in this book. This adaptation into Python will provide a convenient avenue for Python users to apply powerful forecasting concepts, strategies, and techniques in a programming language they are comfortable with.

While our work is ongoing, we warmly welcome additional contributors to join us in this endeavor. Your expertise and passion could significantly enhance this project.

This repository is an invaluable tool for Python users of all experience levels, whether they're newcomers to forecasting or seasoned veterans seeking a refresher. 

Embark on your journey of Python-based forecasting today, and happy forecasting!
