# Preamble #
------------
Forecasting time series is a disciple that extends many fields and there is great materials for learning its theory and applications, including tools and code bases to quickly setup and evaluate models. This repository adapts and extends open material for learning about forecasting. It is based on [Forecasting: Principles and Practice](https://otexts.com/fpp3/), by Rob J. Hyndman and George Athanasopoulos, and its python version: https://otexts.com/fpppy/ 

If you are not interested in running the notebooks in colab, not particularly interested specifically in broad field on forecasting applied to the energy domain, please refer to the [original repository](https://github.com/Nixtla/fpp3-python) and [2] created by Azul Garza and co-authors.
