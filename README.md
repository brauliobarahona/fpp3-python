# Python Adaptation of "Forecasting: Principles and Practice"

This repository adapts some of the material in [Forecasting: Principles and Practice](https://otexts.com/fpp3/), by Rob J. Hyndman and George Athanasopoulos, into Jupyter notebooks that can be run in colab.

If not interested in running the notebooks in colab, refer to the [original repository](https://github.com/Nixtla/fpp3-python) created by Azul Garza
